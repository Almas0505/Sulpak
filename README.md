## üìñ Project Description

The **Sulpak Data Analytics Project** aims to provide deep insights into product trends and price analysis for the **Sulpak.kz** website. By parsing data such as product names, prices, and descriptions, we perform comprehensive **data analysis** and generate meaningful visualizations to understand customer trends, popular categories, and product pricing.

### Key Features:
- **Web scraping** of product data using **BeautifulSoup**.
- **Data cleaning** and preprocessing with **Pandas**.
- **Data visualization** using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**.
- **Machine Learning** models to predict product prices and categories.
- **Interactive charts** and **treemaps** to represent data.

The project helps to analyze e-commerce product behavior, spot pricing trends, and predict future product behavior using data science and machine learning techniques.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the project.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For extracting data from HTML pages.
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests to fetch the website's data.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For handling numerical data.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizing data in various forms like histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive plots and dashboards.
- **Scikit-learn**: For applying machine learning algorithms (e.g., regression, classification).
- **Squarify**: For generating treemaps to visualize product categories.
